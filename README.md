BOSS mini project viral analysis miniproject

## Description
Aim:

The study will use bioinformatics approaches. In this project, participants will be required to use the provided files described in the manuscript to perform data preprocessing, variant calling, alignment, assembly and phylogenetic analysis as described by the manuscript. Participants will use any pipeline used in the study, interpret the output files, critique it, compare with other available pipelines or even come up with a better pipeline.
